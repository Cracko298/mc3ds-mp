## Overview
  This pack endeavors to raise MC3DS to the standards of Mojang today. This includes a full replacement of all vanilla textures with the textures introduced in 1.14, a darker, cleaner UI, new water colors, a new font, parity changes, fixes, and much, much more. 

  This pack now includes the Classic texture pack, which replicates the look of Java Edition Alpha!

_This pack contains the following community-made mods from talented modders in the MC3DS community, as well as mods made specifically for this pack:_
  - Cracko298's Enhanced Particles patch
  - Cracko298's port of the Mojangles (default Minecraft & MC3DS 1.0) font
  - TheRustico36's Cleann'slick GUI (v3.1) with adjustments made for this pack
  - TheRustico36's port of the post-Java 1.19.3 Steve and Alex skins
  - Zexlo's port of the post-Java 1.14 villager models and textures
